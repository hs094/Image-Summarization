# 📌 Image-Summarization

## 🔥 Multimodal Content Generation using Google’s Gemini Models

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that enables chat-based text generation and image summarization using Google’s Gemini models (gemini-1.5-flash for vision tasks and gemini-pro for text generation).

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Chat & Image Summarization – Generate responses based on text prompts and images.
✅ Text-to-Image – Expandable multimodal capability (future implementation).
✅ Real-time Streaming – Get responses word-by-word using a simulated streaming effect.
✅ User-friendly Interface – Simple and interactive UI with image upload support.

## 🖼️ Usage
1.	Upload an image (optional).
2.	Enter a text prompt in the chatbox.
3.	The model will process the input and generate text responses.
4.	If an image is uploaded, the model will generate a multimodal response combining vision and text.
